# Instant-Messaging-Socket-Programming
Networked applications typically interface with IP via either the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP). Sockets offers an Application Programming Interface to both UDP and TCP. 
This project investigates the Sockets interface and produce a small networked application (i.e. IM system).
This system includes a server component that handles the transfer of messages and other data, and a client component with 
a graphical user interface.

The purpose of this project is: 
1- learn several Java technologies, including networking (to support 
connectivity over a network), sockets and I/O (to support real-time, text-based 
communication), and threads (to support two or more people communicating 
concurrently). 
2- become familiar with Swing; a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java,
learn important GUI programming concepts including the notion of a view hierarchy and the model-view-controller design pattern,
use event-based programming,
and confront user interface design challenges.

For simplicity, this IM system will not use 
authentication, meaning that anyone can log in as a client and claim any username (an 
arbitrary string of maximum size of 10 characters) they choose.
